	* l4d_tank_on_spawn_director_waves_interval_min - def.: 0 - (before finale) Minimum random start time (in sec.) required before allowing director to spawn a new tank wave after the last tank died

	Default: disabled. (optionally) Recommended values to fix problems (when only they take place): 30 / 60 / 180 respectively.
	
	- Added ConVar "l4d_tank_on_spawn_enable_duplicate" - Enable tanks duplication (1 - On / 0 - Off, in this case plugin will only control tank's hp)
	- Made ConVar "l4d_tank_on_spawn_enabled" to be dynamically tracked.
	- Tank spawn check (and hp assigning) is 0.1 sec. delayed now to give more flexibility for 3rd party plugins.

1.28 (06-Feb-2022)
	- Changed many ConVar's default values to prevent misunderstanding like "why the number of tanks spawned is different to the one I voted":
	* Autobalancer is disabled by default. Read "Settings" section carefully to understand how to enable.
	- Added ConVar "l4d_tank_on_spawn_mapstart_relax_time" - Prevent director from spawning tanks within this number of seconds after map started
	- Added ConVar "l4d_tank_on_spawn_info_level" - Duplicate service (vote) information? 0 - No, 1 - In console, 2 - In server. (Can be combined)
	- Added compatiblity with listen servers (thanks to @Marttt).
	- Added translation into Hungarian (thanks to @KasperH).
	- Corrected some translation colors.

1.30 (21-Feb-2022)
	- Removed privately hardcoded decreasing tank count on 2 maps of L4D1.
	- Fixed menu selected values aren't preserved for the next campaign (conflicting with ConVars Anomaly Fixer's "Round Start" enforcer).
	- Make "left4dhooks" to be really optional.

========================================================================================
	Description:
	
	Written as more reliable replacement of MultiTanks with other set of features.
	
	This plugin spawns tank:
	 - on first map after delay specified in ConVar when the first player leave safe area
	 - duplicate tanks on the next maps each time when director spawn the tank
	
	Tanks count to spawn can be adjusted:
	 - directly (by ConVar or by vote menu in any time).
	 - using balancer (based on current players count + game difficulty: see l4d_tank_on_spawn_players_X and l4d_tank_on_spawn_add_tanks_X ConVars).
	
	Tanks spawn one by one with an interval defined in l4d_tank_on_spawn_interval ConVar.
	
	Tank HP can be adjusted by:
	 - ConVar
	 - vote menu
	 - or disable controlling hp at all
	 (if l4d_tank_on_spawn_countmode == 1, vote menu hp is preserved for all maps, otherwise it is preserved for current map only)
	
	All votes are logged to logs/vote_tanks.log
	By default, vote can be started by admin with StartVote "k" flag (adjusted by ConVar)
		
========================================================================================
	
	Requirements:
	 - GeoIP extension (included in SourceMod).
	 - (optional) Left4DHooks Direct
	 - Game director should work properly (If it doesn't spawn tank, this plugin doesn't append tank as well, excepting first map if you set l4d_tank_on_spawn_fm_chance > 0).
	
	Conflicts:
	 - Supertanks and any plugin that hooks "z_max_player_zombies" ConVar and reset (lock) it immediately on its own (LOL).
	
	Languages:
	 - English
	 - Russian
